## compile

- [fastbuild](https://github.com/fastbuild/fastbuild)

  FASTBuild is a build system for Windows, OSX and Linux, supporting distributed compilation and object caching. It is used by many game developers, from small independent teams to some of the largest studios in the world.

  FASTBuild's focus is on fast compile times in both full build and local iteration scenarios.

  A large variety of compilers and target architectures are supported. More details, including hosted documentation and Binary downloads can be found here: [http://fastbuild.org](http://fastbuild.org/)

## code analysis

- [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)

  [**Cppcheck** is a ](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/#paying)[static analysis tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_analysis_tool) for C/C++ code. It provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have very few false positives).

  ### Undefined behaviour

  - Dead pointers
  - Division by zero
  - Integer overflows
  - Invalid bit shift operands
  - Invalid conversions
  - Invalid usage of STL
  - Memory management
  - Null pointer dereferences
  - Out of bounds checking
  - Uninitialized variables
  - Writing const data
